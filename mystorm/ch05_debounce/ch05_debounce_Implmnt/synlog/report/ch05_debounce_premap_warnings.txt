@W: MT529 :"/home/ed/dev/prog_fpgas/mystorm/ch05_debounce/src/debouncer.v":26:0:26:5|Found inferred clock debounce|CLK which controls 43 sequential elements including d1.count[16:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
