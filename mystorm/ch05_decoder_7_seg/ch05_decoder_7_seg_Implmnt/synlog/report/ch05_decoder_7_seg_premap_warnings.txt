@W: MT529 :"/home/ed/dev/prog_fpgas/mystorm/ch05_decoder_7_seg/src/decoder_7_seg.v":7:0:7:5|Found inferred clock seg_test|CLK which controls 14 sequential elements including decoder.SEG[6:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
